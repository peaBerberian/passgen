# passgen

This is a super simple client-side password generator (relying mostly on the
[Math.random](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random)
 JavaScript API).

To run it: https://peaberberian.github.io/passgen/

## Why?

I historically wrote one that I ran locally both because I didn't have a lot of trust on ones available online and for fun.

Porting one running on the web client-side wasn't hard so I decided to make this project.
